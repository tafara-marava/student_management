## Overview

**Project Title**:  
Student Management System

**Project Description**:  
This project is a simple Python-based Student Management System that interacts with an SQLite database to manage student records. It allows users to add, update, delete, and query student data. The system uses SQL queries to interact with the database, and it provides a console-based interface for users to perform operations on student records.

**Project Goals**:  
- Create a SQL database to store student records.
- Implement functions to query, add, update, and delete student records.
- Provide a simple user interface to interact with the database through these functions.

## Instructions for Build and Use

### Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Ensure Python and SQLite are installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
3. Open the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the `main.py` file using the command: `python main.py`.

### Instructions for using the software:

1. Upon running `main.py`, a menu will appear offering options to add, update, delete, or query student records.
2. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input or modify student data.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add validation for user inputs (e.g., checking for valid student IDs, dates, etc.)
* [ ] Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
* [ ] Expand the system to allow for tracking of course enrollments and grades.
* [ ] Add functionality to export or import data from CSV files.
